Hey,

I have some demo apps posted here.  Mostly I write exemplars to teach my peers how to implement a given pattern.  I also have a couple personal projects that get very little attention.

If you have any questions, email me a visionarycoder@live.com.  Put [GitHub Question] in the header to catch my eye.  My span filter can be very aggressive, so make sure you write something meaningful.

visionarycoder/visionarycoder is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
